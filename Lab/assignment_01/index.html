		<p>A free bird leaps on the back</p>
		<p>Of the wind and floats downstream </p>
		<p>Till the current ends and dips his wing </p>

		<p>And dares to claim the sky.</p>

		<p>But a BIRD that stalks down his narrow cage</p>

		<p>So he opens his throat to sing.</p>

		<p>The caged bird sings with a fearful trill</p>
		<p>Of things unknown but longed for still</p>
		<p>And his tune is heard on the distant hill for</p>
		<p>The caged bird sings of freedom.</p>

	<div class= "text4">
		<p>The free bird thinks of another breeze</p>
		<p>And the trade winds soft through</p>
		<p>The sighing trees</p>
		<p>And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright</p>
		<p>Lawn and he names the sky his own.</p>

		<p>So he opens his throat to sing.</p>
